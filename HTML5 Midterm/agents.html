                <h4>About Django</h4>
                <p>Django is a highly skilled Realtor who prides himself with an easy-to-approach persona and as a supremely organized professional. Django is a student of Wisconsin Real Estate, keeping his finger on the pulse of the market like few others do. His commitment, expertise and love for Real Estate has earned him the respect of sellers, buyers, builders and contemporaries alike. While typically focusing on the Jefferson and Western Waukesha County real estate markets, Django has participated in numerous real estate transactions through out the State of Wisconsin. Django has sat on the Jefferson County Board of Realtors for seven years and served as the twice, peer-elected President of the Board.<br>

                    <blockquote>Sellers: When listing your property with Django, you will receive an aggressive and relentless, state of the art web and social media based marketing campaign - Django has never NOT been able to present his Seller with an Offer. Django understands the wording of Offer contingencies to the letter. He provides invaluable counsel in such matters. Django will keep you up to date on the sales process from Acceptance to Close.</blockquote> 
                    
                    <blockquote>Buyers: As a dedicated, full-time real estate professional, Django receives minute-to-minute updates through strategic networking with other agents, builders, Buyers and Sellers; he often knows of properties before they hit the market. This amounts to you having a better edge on competing buyers and a higher probability of both finding a home that matches your search criteria and negotiating successfully for that home.</blockquote> 
                    
                    <blockquote>Knowledge: In a fast-paced market, sometimes hours make all the difference between successfully negotiating for the home you have been looking for and a missed sale. Knowledge of the market, when to move on an offer and then moving quickly is key. Django is a student of the market; He keeps his finger of the pulse of the market and market trends like few others.</blockquote> 
                    
                    Django and his wife own and manage a number of rental properties in the area and Django has used his skill in that market to help several Buyers invest and begin their own rental property portfolio. 
                    
                    Before beginning his career in Real Estate, Django spent nearly a decade as a Territory Manager for Case Construction Equipment and then later, John Deere. Django is an aviation, boating and outdoor enthusiast, helpless coffee addict, devout fan of the Green Bay Packers and a proud Eagle Scout. When not practicing real estate, one might find Django and his wife, Jessica enjoying time with friends and family or exploring the great state of Wisconsin with their two dogs, Roxy and Sunny.</p>

I own and operate a successful landscaping business that allows me to work with clients from every walk of life. Additionally, I understand real estate and the inner workings of how the industry works. At the age of 18, I dove into the real estate market and purchased my very first investment property, giving me an in-depth understanding of how real estate transactions are conducted and how important it is to understand the buying and selling process from start to finish. As a client, I knew I could provide a better real estate experience and that drove me to help others experience the best-in-class real estate experience.

                    Don’t let my young looks fool you, my experiences as an entrepreneur and drive to help others achieve their goals is unmatched. If you need a realtor who knows the local markets, will give 110%, can break down barriers, and understands that I only succeed if my clients succeed, give me a call and let’s discuss your real estate needs.</p>

                <p>Juan grew up as an avid hunter and fisherman in southern Wisconsin with his father.

At PF he worked with chapters and a team of Farm Bill Biologist to raise money in support of habitat projects, outdoor heritage events, conservation advocacy, public property acquisition, conservation grant writing and with the various farm bill programs.
                    
                    His knowledge, experience and passion for wild lands makes him the ideal advocate for his clients in buying and selling rural properties. He believes that the value of land is not just what it is today, but what it could be tomorrow.
