            <p>Hello! Im Ryan Fu, Regional Vice President at RossCo Real Estate Group in Wisconsin. I began my serial Entrepreneurship in 1993 and I eventually found a career where there was consistency, good pay, and stability. Who needs that, so I quickly gave it up in 1999 for a commission-only real estate sales career where I had no experience or knowledge at the time. Sheer grit or maybe stubbornness got me through all the tough times as I created systems and processes for my deficiencies. Yes, I have lots and lots of systems and processes! <img src="img/team.jpg" alt="team" width="400" height="193" class="team" />  After creating a consistency once again I was on for a search for inconsistencies. I have a passion and obligation to help others not go through the pains that I experienced by coaching and helping them find their solutions. I continue to coach and train daily and feel its how I am wired and my obligation to not only create great relationships and share my knowledge but to constantly learn, i.e. fail forward every day. I and always searching to surround myself with people who strive to make themselves better. My motto has always been "Leave Things Better Than You Found Them."</p>
